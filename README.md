# ConvertH264ToMP4Example
This is a very simple project converting "H264" to "MP4" files in Java.
This is clearly converting files. I have used isoparser API to convert it.

You can download isoparser all jar files in this link:  http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/googlecode/mp4parser/isoparser/

I used 1.1.9 revision.

Have a nice coding.
